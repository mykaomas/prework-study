        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>CSS defines the style of the "house" ie windows, decorations, chimney</li>
      <li>Using the style element defines the CSS style that will be associated with the website</li>
      <li>When assigining colors we can use the hexadecimal code to pick from a wide range of colors</li>
      <li>When adding external CSS code the code has to be linked back to the HTML code in order to have the changes visible</li>
      <li>DRY aka Do Not Repeat Yourself groups elements with the same styling together to avoid repetition</li>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want outside the element while padding indicates how much space we want inside the element around our content</li>

      <li>Git commands always start with git</li>
      <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
      <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

      <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
      <li>A function's name is always followed up with parentheses</li>
      <li>Array is a single variable that holds a group of data</li>
      <li>The location of the data item in an array is called an index.</li>
      <li>Arrays are zero-indexed so the first item in an array starts with 0 not 1.</li>
      <li>Defining a function does not mean it will execute in our code automatically</li>
