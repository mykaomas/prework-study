# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My motivation was to get a headstart on my coding bootcamp experience. It provided me a framework for what was to take part in class. Doing the prework provided me insight into parts of coding I excel in and parts of code I may need help with in the future. 
- I built this project as a way to encapsulate my start as a developer with very little experience in coding. After bootcamp I'll be able to look back on how I've evolved as a devloper.
- This Prework Study Guide was created for students who are working through the Prework portion of their bootcamp. The study guide includes notes on HTML, CSS, Github and JavaScript.
- I've learned how HTML, CSS and JavaScript build websites and how each play a key component in the success of a webpage. The biggest takeaway from my prework experience is that I've learned how to code!
